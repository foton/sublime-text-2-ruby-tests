//ALL COMMENT SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE USE
//1) RENAMING  THIS FILE TO 'dependecies.json' WILL MAKE Package Control to 'Installing 1 missing dependency'.
//   EVEN IF Terminal IS ALLREADY INSTALLED
//   WHICH THEN LEAD TO: 
//   "./package_control/package_manager.py", line 1317, in install_package"
//   "KeyError: 'load_order'"
//2) so I EXPECT to Terminal Package IS instaled and importing it directly in 'run_ruby_test.py'
